            in his KCPE he advanced to Muranga High School where he was able to succeed in his KCSE so that he could

              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                Joshua, my light-skin friend. 
                I remember when you moved to same plot where we'd ride bikes, and that's 
                where our journey of friendship began. From that moment on, we created 
                memories that will live with me forever.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                I remember us eating mutura with the squad, everyone fighting for the last piece, 
                and you, in your mature way, saying "sasa ona ulafi" to call out the greed. I 
                remember how you would load your food with pilipili until we had no choice but 
                to nickname you "Mhindi", and we'd all laugh. I remember you playing ball with 
                us, and you were genuinely good at it.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                I remember us riding bikes until we were completely worn out. Even in high 
                school, during the holidays, we kept riding. Sometimes you would simply visit us 
                and keep us company, and honestly, that alone was more than enough.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                Your birthday is on Tuesday next week. Many times you had travelled upcountry, 
                so we made it a tradition to revisit it on the 31st of December, staying out all 
                night, just for the plot.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                For those of us who knew you closely, we knew you could shika moto at times, 
                short-tempered, but you always used that fire to defend your friends. We used to 
                tease you because you'd turn pink when angry, which only made us laugh even 
                more.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                I remember an altercation where you were teasing Patrick about bikes, only for 
                him to later join Form One and find you there at Murang'a High School. Life really 
                has a way of crossing paths.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                In campus, we made even more memories, going to parks, long walks, swimming. 
                You were always somewhere near nyama choma, which you loved so much. You 
                even went out of your way to grill nyama for us on Muchiri's 21st birthday.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                We used to play Monopoly, and you were always the accountant, because you 
                never played favorites. Sometimes we would even be mad at you, but later we'd 
                laugh about it.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                I remember our time as true comrades. When I was struggling financially, you 
                never hesitated to step in, sometimes in the simplest way, by making sure I had a 
                meal when things were hard. When you got a job, it became easier for us to 
                spend meaningful time together, and even then, you would lend us money and 
                say "na mrudishe," knowing very well we were jobless at the time and couldn't. 
                You never complained. You were patient with us. And whenever you needed help, 
                I showed up too, that's how we looked out for each other.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                I remember Maureen telling me how they grew up side by side, sharing innocent 
                laughter, childhood secrets, scraped knees, and dreams that felt bigger than the 
                world they lived in. She spoke of knowing Joshua before life added weight and 
                responsibility, and how, even then, he was more than a friend, he was family. And 
                I know Maureen wishes to carry those childhood memories with her forever, 
                holding space for him in her heart.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                I remember Tiffany telling me how Joshua was a brother from another mother, a 
                caring neighbor who made everyday life meaningful. They cooked and ate 
                together, played pool and PlayStation, took walks, talked about CPA, and shared 
                simple moments that mattered. She said Joshua helped her embrace her 
                extroverted nature, and they had plans to meet again. And I know Tiffany wishes 
                to continue to check in on his family and keep that bond alive in the ways she can.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph tribute-signature">

              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                Muranga High School, we mzee, it is still unreal that you had gone. You taught us what brotherhood was, especially during our high school years, and occasionally later on, when we were in various universities and colleges. You were so generous, so humorous and could always say to us how we should always smile no matter what we were going through.

            <div class="tribute-card-content">
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                We are gathered here to celebrate Jesse not to the fullest but enjoyed to the fullest. In this time of sorrow words may not seem enough but need to be said to remind us that in time of sorrow we are not alone. When I received news of his passing I was in disbelief as I had talked to him a few minutes prior to his accident. It all seemed like a painful dream that had no ending and I wasn't convinced it had happened. I'm still in shock and denial about what happened.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                I met Joshua in the year 2021 not so long ago as he was walking home. We didn't say much to each other then just greetings and that was it. Little did we know that it was the beginning of a friendship that would transcend to brotherhood. We would hangout on a regular playing a regular game of pool in which I never won a single game against him or playing FIFA in which he only beat me once. He would always find a reason to call someone either to tell him any news happening in his life, play the occasional the occasional football game with Thuo and Karanja or the occasional UJI here and there. Our favourite time to be together was during the weekends when he stay over at our place and prepare breakfast for all his friends. We used to have Sunday lunches with him, Peter, Allan or any other friends who decided to join us for the weekend. We would talk about all our goals and plans for future . It was usually the best time of the week in that we would lose track of time and he would find himself leaving early Monday morning to attend work.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                He loved being in the presence of friends and family as buffer from all the pressures of life. He was always a jolly guy , smiling in the midst and chaos and always finding a way of making people smile. He loved sitting among friends reminiscing old times with his favourite word being unakumbuka or the word ooohhh when he remembered a certain story and had to be the one to tell it.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                His kindness knew no bounds. In a world full of people looking out for themselves, Joshua was always one to look out for the little guy or any other guy. Whether it was a friend or a stranger he had met on the road. He was willing to help his friends in any way, shape or form. No was never an option to him, he just knew he had to help somehow.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                He taught me the art of being responsible in my duties and finances. He'd never miss a day of work without informing the management or shirk away from any responsibilities handed to him. The guy was financially disciplined and budgeted for all his money without compromise.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                His love for his family was without bounds. To Mum, Joshua loved and respected you and had amazing plans for you and the children. To Lee, I know Josh was a bit hard on you but he was grooming you to be best version of yourself. He loved you and was eager to show you the ways of the world and help you avoid mistakes he made while still a teenager. To the rest of the brothers he loved you immensely and was trying to be the best big brother he could. To Uncle Shem and Patrick, Joshua looked up to you as father figures and was always talking praise about you guys and how you would help him at any inconvenience.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph">
                To his friends Benson Kamau and Nathaniel Kamau, Joshua viewed you as big brothers and role models. To his friends Kagwe, Alvin, Precious, Laban, Kibe, Musau, Tracy ,he viewed you guys as family and couldn't wait to spend his free time with you guys. Whether it was swimming or the regular UJI, he enjoyed being a part of your lives. To Tessy, I remembered about the time he told me about you. He was ecstatic a jolly as a baby and couldn't wait to show me your pictures and how he met you. He loved and adored you immensely. On Thursday he'd gone to get a haircut ready to meet you on Saturday. He'd planned out his whole weekend out from getting a haircut and getting you flowers on Saturday. I am sorry for a love lost yet so young. I hope you find comfort in knowing that he loved you.
              </p>
              <p class="tribute-paragraph tribute-signature">
                You were an amazing Son, friend, brother, nephew, grandson and boyfriend. This loss has left us devastated and broken. No what ifs can bring you back to us but we will continue to carry you in our hearts and minds and tell the future generations of the great Uncle Josh.
                Rest in peace Josh. You will be missed.
